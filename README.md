# DFS HUB

DFS HUB is a comprehensive learning platform designed for IT-Akademy students, focusing on the DÃ©veloppeur Full Stack (DFS) curriculum and RNCP certification resources. This project is developed as part of the RNCP certification process.

## Project Overview

DFS HUB aims to provide a centralized platform for DFS students to access learning resources, track their progress, and prepare for RNCP certification. The platform is built with a focus on modern web development practices and technologies.

## Key Features

- User Authentication (Local and GitHub OAuth)
- User Profiles with Learning Activity Tracking
- Learning Resource Management (Courses, Tutorials, Articles)
- RNCP Certification Information and Resources
- Personalized Learning Paths
- Q&A Section
- Real-time Collaboration
- Admin Panel for User Management

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: Symfony 6.2
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: Doctrine
- **Frontend**: Twig templating engine, JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Symfony Security, KnpU OAuth2 Client Bundle
- **API**: RESTful API with Symfony
- **Real-time Features**: WebSockets (planned)
- **Search**: Elasticsearch (planned)
- **Caching**: Redis (planned)
- **Testing**: PHPUnit

## Technical Details

### Backend Architecture

- MVC architecture using Symfony's best practices
- Doctrine ORM for database interactions
- Custom services for business logic
- Event listeners for specific application events

### Security Measures

- Symfony Security for authentication and authorization
- CSRF protection
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- OAuth2 integration for GitHub login
- Role-based access control (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_MENTOR, ROLE_STUDENT)

### Database Design

- Relational database schema optimized for learning resource management
- Entities: User, Course, Lesson, Question, Answer, UserProgress, UserActivity

### API Design

- RESTful API endpoints for resource management
- JWT authentication for API access

### Performance Optimizations

- Doctrine query optimization
- Lazy loading of related entities
- Caching strategies (to be implemented)

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for critical business logic
- Functional tests for controllers and API endpoints
- Integration tests for database interactions

## Recent Updates

- Implemented an admin panel for user management
- Enhanced user roles system (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_MENTOR, ROLE_STUDENT)
- Added user activity tracking
- Improved security configuration and access control
- Created a dashboard for user profile and activity display

## RNCP Certification Relevance

This project demonstrates competencies in:

1. Designing and modeling web applications
2. Developing the frontend and backend of web applications
3. Implementing database design and management
4. Ensuring application security
5. Integrating third-party services (OAuth)
6. Applying best practices in software development
7. Implementing user role management and access control

By developing DFS HUB, we aim to showcase skills as Full Stack Developers and meet the requirements for RNCP certification.
